### Github Discussions

We enabled the [GitHub Discussions for the abp repository](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/discussions) as another place to discuss ideas or get help for the ABP Framework. The ABP core team is spending time participating in discussions and answering to questions as much as possible.

## About the Next Release(s)

Beginning from the next version (4.2.0), we are starting to spend more effort on the **CMS Kit module**. The purpose of this module is to provide CMS primitives (e.g. **comments, tags, reactions, contents**...) and features (e.g. **blog, pages, surveys**) as pre-built and reusable components. Current blog module will be a part of the CMS Kit module. We will continue to prepare documents, guides, tutorials and examples. And surely, we will continue to make enhancements and optimizations on the current features.

> The planned preview release date for the version 4.2.0 is January 14, 2021 and the final (stable) version release date is January 28, 2021.

Follow the [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestones) for all the planned ABP Framework version release dates.
